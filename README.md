# DietPlanner
An ultimate guide to plan your diet

A user can add deifferent menus, indicating the ingredients of each, its type, etc.
Once all desired menus are added, user can add these menus on a weekly calender. 
User can add reminder prior to cooking. Also user can keep track of grocery items.
For example, we can add the grocery list in the beginning. After each menu is prepared user have to check the status box.
This will reduce the items from grocery item and prepare a grocery list for user by week end or by the day specified by user.

Other activities like exercise, prayer time, medicine, etc can also be added. Reminder would be given for each.
